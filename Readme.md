# Mator's anilist style tweaks [![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matortheeternal/anilist-tweaks/master/mators%20anilist%20tweaks.user.css)

Just some minor tweaks for things on anilist that have annoyed me or other users.  Nothing special.

## List of tweaks

### Improved visibility of note and repeat icons

The note and repeat icons on anime lists are white with drop shadow, but when displayed on anime cards that have white or off-white backgrounds  they are barely visible.  This tweak adds additional drop shadow to make them stand out more.

### Increased size of favorite thumbnails

The favorites page on profiles displays very small thumbnails with a lot of space between them and has 11 entries per row at the largest media  breakpoint (1550px width+).  This tweak increases their size and  displays 10 entries per row at the largest media breakpoint.

### Increased size of smiley face ratings

The smiley face ratings on anime lists are kind of small.  This increases their size to make them more visible.

### Colored smiley face ratings

This colors smiley face ratings on anime lists for clarity.  Smile is green, meh is orange, and frown is red.
